# Welcome to my GitHub Profile ðŸŽ‰

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @HenryAgu

I'm a Frontend Developer and I love bringing designs to life using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, reactjs.

Here's a list of things I'm good at:

- HTML: I can write HTML faster than you can say "Hypertext Markup Language"
- CSS: I can make your website look good, even when I am having a bad day
- JavaScript: I can bring your website to life with animations, interactivity and more
- React: I can build scalable, performant and user-friendly applications using React

I love to work on projects that challenge me, push me out of my comfort zone and help me grow as a developer. If you're looking for someone to help you bring your designs to life, you've come to the right place!
